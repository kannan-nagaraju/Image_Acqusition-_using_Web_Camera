# EXP 02: Image Acquisition using Web Camera

## Aim
 
To write a python program using OpenCV to capture the image from the web camera and do the following image manipulations.<br>
i) Write the frame as JPG <br>
ii) Display the video <br>
iii) Display the video by resizing the window<br>
iv) Rotate and display the video

## Software Used
Anaconda - Python 3.7

## Algorithm
### Step 1: 
Start the webcam using cv2.VideoCapture(0) and begin reading frames.
<br>

### Step 2: 
Capture and save a frame as a JPG file using cv2.imwrite().
<br>

### Step 3: 
Display the live video continuously in a window.
<br>

### Step 4:
Resize the frame to half its original size and display the smaller video.
<br>

### Step 5:
Rotate the resized frame (180°) and display it along with the normal frames.
<br>

### Step 6: 
Stop the webcam and close all windows when the user presses ‘q’.
<br>

## Result
The image was successfully captured from the webcam, saved as a JPG file, and displayed as live video. The video was also shown in resized form and rotated, thus achieving all four image acquisition processes using OpenCV.
